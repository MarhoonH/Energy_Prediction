# Energy_Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project that leverages PecanStreet energy data to develop two key solutions: (1) an outlier detection system for identifying anomalous energy consumption, and (2) a predictive model to forecast energy usage for specified periods.

# PecanStreet Energy Data Analysis and Machine Learning Solutions

This project aims to analyze and predict residential energy consumption using PecanStreet data from two selected cities. It includes two primary machine learning objectives:
1. **Outlier Detection**: Identify unusual patterns or anomalies in energy consumption.
2. **Consumption Prediction**: Forecast energy consumption for given periods.

By combining weather data and historical energy data, the project explores the relationships and dependencies between environmental conditions and energy usage patterns.

## Data

Data for this project includes:
- **Energy Consumption Data**: Raw energy consumption data collected from two cities.
- **Weather Data**: City-specific weather data in separate CSV files.

The raw data is stored in the `data/raw` directory, while cleaned and processed data is available in `data/processed`.

### Data Sources

Data in this project is sourced from [PecanStreet](https://www.pecanstreet.org/), which provides anonymized residential energy data for various cities.
